description: 'Using Storybook with NuxtJS is simple, add your stories and run nuxt storybook command.'

First, we need to add the stories for our components, by default `@nuxtjs/storybook` will look into `~/components/**/*.stories.js`.

```bash
components/
  Link.vue
  Link.stories.js
pages/
  index.vue
nuxt.config.js
```

<code-group>

  ```html [Link.vue]
  <template>
    <nuxt-link to="https://nuxtjs.org">
      NuxtJs
    </nuxt-link>
  </template>
  ```


  ```js [Link.stories.js]
  export default {
    title: 'Link'
  }

  export const NuxtWebsite = () => '<Link />'
  ```

</code-group>

Then we can run the [development command](/commands#development) with `npx nuxt storybook` and go to [http://localhost:3003](http://localhost:3003), you will see our first story:

You can extend where `@nuxtjs/storybook` will load the stories in the [stories option](/options#stories).
